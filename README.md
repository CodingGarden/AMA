  * How would you secure an api without any sort of user login? For example your front end hits a third party api using an api key. Since you can't securely store the api key on the front end, you move that api call to a node backend. But is there a way to prevent others from accessing your api?

  * a silly question: I’ve never had my own hosting and domain. I use services like now.sh or heroku to deploy my website. What should I know before deploying my website using my own domain and hosting? What’s the difference if I want to just deploy a static website vs a full-stack website (client and sever) ?
    * You can buy a domain anywhere...
      * And then configure DNS!

  * @CodingGarden I run in production mode Last week I finished my personal portfolio in NuxtJS and dropped it on my VPS. In order to improve performance, I started looking for some way to speed up NuxtJS. My personal sites dont have much trafic. But i want to recode client sites from php to nodejs. And i dont know if Nuxt is the right way
